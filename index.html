        <p>Hello, my name is Efe Eriomala and I am from Nigeria. I enjoy singing, playing videos games, reading and watching movies. I am currently enrolled in Brigham Young University, pursuing a degree in Software Development. With the experience I had while learning python, I am optimistic about what HTML has in store for me. My journey as a Software Developer has been an enlightening one so far and I hope to learn more as I go further down my career path.
