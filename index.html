        <p>Hello, my name is Efe Eriomala and I am from Nigeria. 
            I enjoy singing, playing videos games, reading and watching movies. 
            I am currently enrolled in Brigham Young University, pursuing a degree in Software Development. 
            With the experience I had while learning python, I am optimistic about what HTML has in store for me. 
            My journey as a Software Developer has been an enlightening one so far and I hope to learn more as I go further down my career path.

        <p>"Zuma Rock is a large natural monolith, 
            or inselberg, an igneous intrusion composed of gabbro and 
            granodiorite, located in Madalla, a town in Niger State, Nigeria.
             It is situated in the west of Nigeria's capital, Abuja, along the main road from Abuja to Kaduna, 
             off Madalla, and is sometimes referred to as the "Gateway to Abuja from Suleja".
             Zuma Rock rises approx. 300 metres (980 ft) above its surroundings. 
             It was once thought to be in the Federal Capital Territory but is actually located at 
             the upper end of Madalla, a rural settlement in Suleja Local Government Area of Niger State." - Wiki
